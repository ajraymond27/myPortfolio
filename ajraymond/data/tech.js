Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”. The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes. Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.',

As the species move through the supply chain of drying, cleaning, prepping, storing, planting, and growing, employees can easily update its progress while recording important data. As this data is kept up-to-date, manamgement could gain insight from several dashboards that visualized specie origins, supply chain KPIs, and sales projections",

                description: 'Our co-founders Dr. Amani Jambhekar and Dr. Mona Stone are surgeons who wanted to find a way to give back to communities in need.The greatest need for healthcare professionals on the front lines is masks — masks are the first line of defense when dealing directly with COVID-19 patients. However, healthcare professionals are being asked to reuse and conserve although this increases their risk of contracting COVID-19 or infecting their families. Many have fallen ill or been put in self-quarantine. Over 200 healthcare professionals have lost their lives worldwide due to inadequate protection. Front line medical professionals need our help to continue their fight to save lives. The situation is even direr for smaller facilities in hard hit areas which don’t have the resources or media presence to ask the public for donations. As a solution to this supply gap, our model is to leverage our network to source surgical masks from certified factories and deliver them directly to the communities with the most urgent need. We started this campaign to help fund the operation and are pledging 100% of donations go toward purchasing and delivering masks.',
